        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Denton's Pet Shop opened its doors in Milledgeville, Georgia in 2010, born from a deep passion for animals and a desire to serve the local community. Over the years, we’ve grown to become one of the most trusted names for pet owners in the area. What started as a small family-run business has evolved into a full-service pet store offering everything from food and toys to grooming and health services.</p>
        <p>Our commitment to the well-being of your pets drives everything we do. We believe that every animal deserves love, care, and quality products, and we strive to make sure our store reflects that belief.</p>
